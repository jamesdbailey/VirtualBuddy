# Fixed in VirtualBuddy 1.2.2

- Makes custom IPSW URL validation less strict, allowing downloads from plain HTTP URLs and URLs that don't end in .ipsw
- Addresses an issue that caused audio input to not work in virtual machines; VirtualBuddy will ask for microphone access the first time audio input is used within a virtual machine
