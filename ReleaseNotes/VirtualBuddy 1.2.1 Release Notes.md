# New in VirtualBuddy 1.2.1

### General improvements to the installer user interface:

- Addresses an issue that caused the installer to clip the configuration user interface, hiding the "continue" button
- It is now possible to navigate using the arrow keys when selecting the installation method
- Text fields now use the same consistent style
- The virtual machine name button is automatically focused as expected
- Command + R can be used to generate a new random name while editing the virtual machine's name during installation
